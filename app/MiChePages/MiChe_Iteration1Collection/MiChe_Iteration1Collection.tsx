                        "Ah, the freedom days. When time was a resource I readily had access to, and behind me were shelves filled with different colors of paint.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        I vaguely remember making these, bringing them into existence. I think I was watching one of the movie recap videos; I'm not sure. I don't think I was fully there, but when am I ever.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        I always say that I value the brilliance of people truly dedicated to their craftâ€”dedicated as in, 'I spend 30 hours on this single thing that regular people only spend 5 minutes on, but it's worth it because what I've made is that much better.' However, I've also come to value spontaneous bursts of creativity. Sure, maybe I don't feel the same level of satisfaction from completing a piece that takes an hour versus one that took a year. But from afar, it doesn't matter because both look so damn good.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        I'm not really sure where I'm going with this. I'm currently in the basement of an engineering building procrastinating doing work from two weeks ago.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        I probably should care more. I probably should spend more effort making sure I do every bit of everything right. But that's boring. And boredom is the ultimate destroyer of creativity and my personal will to go on.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        So no. I'm not gonna spend weeks on a painting to make it so gosh darn intricate that you can't stop staring at it. I'm gonna splash random colors on a canvas until I see something and go from there. I'll keep going until I don't want to anymore. That's how I know it's done. Not necessarily because the painting is finished but because I'm finished, and I wanna go take a nap."
